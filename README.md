READ ME
Within this appsmith repo, users can either be customers or vendors. They can select which type of user they are.

If we take a look from the customer's perspective, the user will be able to select the options to see notifications, discounts, or products. Within discounts, they can sort by added date to see all the details about the discount/deal. They can also sort by the brand to group the table based on the brand in case they are looking for something in particular. Lastly, they can organize by retailer as well to see what a particular retailer is offering. When pressing products, you can then go to products by type where you can enter a product type and it generates a table where there are products matching the search the customer puts in. The other page you can access is All Products which just shows all the products that are being offered on the app. Notifications leads to a table where it leads to a table where there are notifications. The customer can then clear the notification by pressing the notification. There is also a button to clear all the notifications in case the customer is done looking at the notifications within the app. 

The vendor’s perspective includes the options of discount entry, product entry, tutorials, and notifications entry type pages. The vendor side has an option to take you to the discount entry page which lets the vendor enter a discount and update a discount where changes are reflected within the table. The products page lets you do the same things by entering a new product or updating an existing product within the table. The notifications page on the vendor side will let you make a new notification where the vendor can create a notification to show to the customers. It will let the vendors input details about the notification. Lastly, there is a page that vendors can use to add links to tutorials. They can select the product of which they want to post a tutorial and fill out a form that allows for the link of the tutorial to be inputted.
